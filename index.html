		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<article>
			<p>Raised in the Boston area, I was born in New Orleans, and I visit about once a year.<br>
			I love movies and art, most kinds of music and attend concerts whenever I can.</p>
			<p>I've worked in Corporate Retail, in some capacity, off and on since college and have even worked as a hairstylist. Not a one-trick pony, over here!</p>
			<p>I like to work out, travel, and snuggle with my 3 cats. Cat lady 4-life!</p>
